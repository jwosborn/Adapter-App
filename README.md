# Do I Need An Adapter? App
Application created by _Jeremy Osborn_ in collaboration with _Jonathan Whittle_ for use at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. 

### This application can be accessed at https://sbts-adapter-app.herokuapp.com/. 

### Running Application Locally
## Two terminal windows are needed at this point, one to launch the React app and another to lauch the express api.
## `yarn start` will launch the React app on port 3000, and `yarn api` will spin up the api on port 4000. A `/healthcheck` route has been provided to ensure that the api is responding.
