# Do I Need An Adapter? App
Application created by _Jeremy Osborn_ in collaboration with _Jonathan Whittle_ for use at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. 


### Running Application
## Two terminal windows are needed at this point, one to launch the React app and another to lauch the express api. In the future, both will spin up with one command. `yarn start` will launch the React app on port 3000, and `yarn api` will spin up the api on port 4000. A `/healthcheck` route has been provided to ensure that the api is responding.
